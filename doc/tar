# tar saves time in nanoseconds but that does not help when using git,
# so to create and store timestamps with posix-based time resolution:

  tar cvzHf posix dotgit.tgz .git/*     # .git sub-dir is tarred into dotgit.tgz
  tar xvzf dotgit.tgz                   # to untar
  tar lvzf dotgit.tgz                   # to list files in the tarred archive
