dotfiles
========

This repo holds the dotfiles (.bashrc, .vimrc, etc) of 0xMF. I might randomly use:

  git push -f

on this repo, as and when I make changes locally that I want mirrored publicly. As the sole
benificary of this repo is me, I'd like to have the freedom to update this repo as I wish. 

You are, however, welcome to use and modify. All settings here are available under the [ISC
license](LICENSE)

Best.
