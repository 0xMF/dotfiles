dotfiles
========

This repo holds dot files (.bashrc, .vimrc, ...) for tools I use on a
daily basis. A lot of time and attention goes into keeping this repo up
to date with tricks/tips I learn and with colour themes I like by
tweaking/tinkering, or I come across, but please be aware, in the past,
I have used and, in the future, I might use:

`git push -f`

on this repo without prior notice whenever I make changes to my local
dotfiles repo that I want to mirror publicly. This repo is my backup
strategy. I could not be bothered with the *Thou Shalt Not Rewrite
History Of A Publicly Available Repo* rule because, as the sole
beneficiary of this repo, I want the freedom to update this repo as I
wish.

In other words, I will use the simplest git: commands, strategies, and
methods possible so I can keep this repo in the shape I want without
having to sequence through fancy git commands just for the sake of
maintaining a pristine commit history of a publicly available repo. So,
if you decide to clone this repo, consider yourself adequately warned.
