dotfiles
========

This repo holds dot files (.bashrc, .emacs.d, .vimrc, ...) for tools I
use on a daily basis. A lot of time and attention goes into keeping this
repo up to date with tricks/tips/discoveries I learn about in my daily
interactions with these tools on different operating systems; or with
colour themes I happen to like when I tweak and tinker around with
different colour palettes; or maybe even something new I stumble upon
through a blog post, video, or comment from a fellow cli addict.

*WARNING:* I have and I might use:

`git push -f`

on this repo whenever I make changes to my local dotfiles repo that I
want to mirror publicly. This repo is essentially my backup strategy of
my muscle memory I have learned over time, which means I cannot be
bothered with the *Thou Shalt Not Rewrite History Of A Publicly
Available Repo* rule because, as the intended sole beneficiary of this
repo, I want the freedom to update this repo when and how I wish.

In other words, I use what I consider to be the simplest git: commands,
strategies, and methods possible to keep this repo in the shape I want
without me having to sequence/remember/adhere through fancy git
ceremonies and commands just to maintain a pristine commit history of a
publicly available repo. If you clone this repo and decide to follow
along - consider yourself adequately forewarned. Heh! ;)
