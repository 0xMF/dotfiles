dotfiles
========

This repo holds my dotfiles (.bashrc, .vimrc, ...). I might randomly use:

`git push -f`

on this repo when I make changes locally that I want mirrored publicly
and could not be bothered with rewriting history because, as the sole
beneficiary of this repo, I'd like to have the freedom to update this
repo as I wish; meaning I'd like to use the simplest git way without
having to sequence through fancy git commands just to maintain a
pristine commit history for this public repo.
